[1mNAME[0m
       git-pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. If the current branch is behind the remote, then by default it will
       fast-forward the current branch to match the remote. If the current branch and the remote have diverged, the user needs to specify how to
       reconcile the divergent branches with [1m--rebase [22mor [1m--no-rebase [22m(or the corresponding configuration option in [1mpull.rebase[22m).

       More precisely, [1mgit pull [22mruns [1mgit fetch [22mwith the given parameters and then depending on configuration options or command line flags, will call
       either [1mgit rebase [22mor [1mgit merge [22mto reconcile diverging branches.

       <repository> should be the name of a remote repository as passed to [1mgit-fetch[22m(1). <refspec> can name an arbitrary remote ref (for example, the
       name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g., refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually
       it is the name of a branch in the remote repository.

       Default values for <repository> and <branch> are read from the "remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch as set by [1mgit-[0m
       [1mbranch[22m(1) [1m--track[22m.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "[1mmaster[22m":

                     A---B---C master on origin
                    /
               D---E---F---G master
                   ^
                   origin/master in your repository

       Then "[1mgit pull[22m" will fetch and replay the changes from the remote [1mmaster [22mbranch since it diverged from the local [1mmaster [22m(i.e., [1mE[22m) until its
       current commit ([1mC[22m) on top of [1mmaster [22mand record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from
       the user describing the changes.

                     A---B---C origin/master
                    /         \
               D---E---F---G---H master

       See [1mgit-merge[22m(1) for details, including how conflicts are presented and handled.

       In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use [1mgit reset --merge[22m. [1mWarning[22m: In older versions of Git, running [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m with
       uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

       If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted changes, the merge will be automatically canceled and the work tree untouched. It
       is generally best to get any local changes in working order before pulling or stash them away with [1mgit-stash[22m(1).

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -q, --quiet
           This is passed to both underlying git-fetch to squelch reporting of during transfer, and underlying git-merge to squelch output during
           merging.

       -v, --verbose
           Pass --verbose to git-fetch and git-merge.

       --[no-]recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]
           This option controls if new commits of populated submodules should be fetched, and if the working trees of active submodules should be
           updated, too (see [1mgit-fetch[22m(1), [1mgit-config[22m(1) and [1mgitmodules[22m(5)).

           If the checkout is done via rebase, local submodule commits are rebased as well.

           If the update is done via merge, the submodule conflicts are resolved and checked out.

   [1mOptions related to merging[0m
       --commit, --no-commit
           Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override --no-commit. Only useful when merging.

           With --no-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating a merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the
           merge result before committing.

           Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and therefore there is no way to stop those merges with --no-commit. Thus, if
           you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated by the merge command, use --no-ff with --no-commit.

       --edit, -e, --no-edit
           Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can
           explain and justify the merge. The [1m--no-edit [22moption can be used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged).

           Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor opened
           when they run [1mgit merge[22m. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable [1mGIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT [22mcan
           be set to [1mno [22mat the beginning of them.

       --cleanup=<mode>
           This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up before committing. See [1mgit-commit[22m(1) for more details. In addition, if the
           [4m<mode>[24m is given a value of [1mscissors[22m, scissors will be appended to [1mMERGE_MSG [22mbefore being passed on to the commit machinery in the case of a
           merge conflict.

       --ff-only
           Only update to the new history if there is no divergent local history. This is the default when no method for reconciling divergent
           histories is provided (via the --rebase=* flags).

       --ff, --no-ff
           When merging rather than rebasing, specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in history is already a descendant of the current
           history. If merging is requested, [1m--ff [22mis the default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not stored in its
           natural place in the [1mrefs/tags/ [22mhierarchy, in which case [1m--no-ff [22mis assumed.

           With [1m--ff[22m, when possible resolve the merge as a fast-forward (only update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do not create a
           merge commit). When not possible (when the merged-in history is not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.

           With [1m--no-ff[22m, create a merge commit in all cases, even when the merge could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.

       -S[<keyid>], --gpg-sign[=<keyid>], --no-gpg-sign
           GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The [1mkeyid [22margument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck
           to the option without a space.  [1m--no-gpg-sign [22mis useful to countermand both [1mcommit.gpgSign [22mconfiguration variable, and earlier [1m--gpg-sign[22m.

       --log[=<n>], --no-log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line descriptions from at most <n> actual commits that are being merged. See
           also [1mgit-fmt-merge-msg[22m(1). Only useful when merging.

           With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged.

       --signoff, --no-signoff
           Add a [1mSigned-off-by [22mtrailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which
           you’re committing. For example, it may certify that the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project’s license or agrees
           to some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin. (See [34m[1mhttp://developercertificate.org [0m[1m[22mfor the one used by the
           Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you’re contributing to understand how the
           signoffs are used in that project.

           The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff option on the command line.

       --stat, -n, --no-stat
           Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.

           With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge.

       --squash, --no-squash
           Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a commit,
           move the [1mHEAD[22m, or record [1m$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD [22m(to cause the next [1mgit commit [22mcommand to create a merge commit). This allows you to create a
           single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).

           With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override --squash.

           With --squash, --commit is not allowed, and will fail.

           Only useful when merging.

       --[no-]verify
           By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run. When [1m--no-verify [22mis given, these are bypassed. See also [1mgithooks[22m(5). Only useful
           when merging.

       -s <strategy>, --strategy=<strategy>
           Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no [1m-s [22moption, a
           built-in list of strategies is used instead ([1mort [22mwhen merging a single head, [1moctopus [22motherwise).

       -X <option>, --strategy-option=<option>
           Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy.

       --verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures
           Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the default
           trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid
           key, the merge is aborted.

           Only useful when merging.

       --summary, --no-summary
           Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future.

       --autostash, --no-autostash
           Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation begins, record it in the special ref [1mMERGE_AUTOSTASH [22mand apply it after
           the operation ends. This means that you can run the operation on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application
           after a successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.

       --allow-unrelated-histories
           By default, [1mgit merge [22mcommand refuses to merge histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to override this
           safety when merging histories of two projects that started their lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration
           variable to enable this by default exists and will not be added.

           Only useful when merging.

       -r, --rebase[=false|true|merges|interactive]
           When true, rebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching. If there is a remote-tracking branch corresponding to
           the upstream branch and the upstream branch was rebased since last fetched, the rebase uses that information to avoid rebasing non-local
           changes.

           When set to [1mmerges[22m, rebase using [1mgit rebase --rebase-merges [22mso that the local merge commits are included in the rebase (see [1mgit-rebase[22m(1)
           for details).

           When false, merge the upstream branch into the current branch.

           When [1minteractive[22m, enable the interactive mode of rebase.

           See [1mpull.rebase[22m, [1mbranch.<name>.rebase [22mand [1mbranch.autoSetupRebase [22min [1mgit-config[22m(1) if you want to make [1mgit pull [22malways use [1m--rebase [22minstead
           of merging.

               [1mNote[0m
               This is a potentially [4mdangerous[24m mode of operation. It rewrites history, which does not bode well when you published that history
               already. Do [1mnot [22muse this option unless you have read [1mgit-rebase[22m(1) carefully.

       --no-rebase
           This is shorthand for --rebase=false.

   [1mOptions related to fetching[0m
       --all
           Fetch all remotes.

       -a, --append
           Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of [1m.git/FETCH_HEAD[22m. Without this option old data in
           [1m.git/FETCH_HEAD [22mwill be overwritten.

       --atomic
           Use an atomic transaction to update local refs. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated.

       --depth=<depth>
           Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch history. If fetching to a [4mshallow[24m repository created
           by [1mgit clone [22mwith [1m--depth=<depth> [22moption (see [1mgit-clone[22m(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the specified number of commits. Tags for the
           deepened commits are not fetched.

       --deepen=<depth>
           Similar to --depth, except it specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote
           branch history.

       --shallow-since=<date>
           Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after <date>.

       --shallow-exclude=<revision>
           Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option can
           be specified multiple times.

       --unshallow
           If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow
           repositories.

           If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that the current repository has the same history as the source
           repository.

       --update-shallow
           By default when fetching from a shallow repository, [1mgit fetch [22mrefuses refs that require updating .git/shallow. This option updates
           .git/shallow and accepts such refs.

       --negotiation-tip=<commit|glob>
           By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size
           of the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up
           fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched.

           This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report commits reachable from any of the given commits.

           The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the (possibly abbreviated) SHA-1 of a commit. Specifying a glob is
           equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching ref name.

           See also the [1mfetch.negotiationAlgorithm [22mand [1mpush.negotiate [22mconfiguration variables documented in [1mgit-config[22m(1), and the [1m--negotiate-only[0m
           option below.

       --negotiate-only
           Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors of the provided [1m--negotiation-tip=* [22marguments, which we have in
           common with the server.

           This is incompatible with [1m--recurse-submodules=[yes|on-demand][22m. Internally this is used to implement the [1mpush.negotiate [22moption, see [1mgit-[0m
           [1mconfig[22m(1).

       --dry-run
           Show what would be done, without making any changes.

       --porcelain
           Print the output to standard output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. See section OUTPUT in [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) for details.

           This is incompatible with [1m--recurse-submodules=[yes|on-demand] [22mand takes precedence over the [1mfetch.output [22mconfig option.

       -f, --force
           When [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m is used with [1m<src>:<dst> [22mrefspec, it may refuse to update the local branch as discussed in the [1m<refspec> [22mpart of the [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1) documentation. This option overrides that check.

       -k, --keep
           Keep downloaded pack.

       --prefetch
           Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the [1mrefs/prefetch/ [22mnamespace. See the [1mprefetch [22mtask in [1mgit-maintenance[22m(1).

       -p, --prune
           Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are
           fetched only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a --tags option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec
           (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the --mirror option), then they are
           also subject to pruning. Supplying [1m--prune-tags [22mis a shorthand for providing the tag refspec.

       --no-tags
           By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This option disables
           this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with the remote.<name>.tagOpt setting. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       --refmap=<refspec>
           When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote-tracking
           branches, instead of the values of [1mremote.*.fetch [22mconfiguration variables for the remote repository. Providing an empty [1m<refspec> [22mto the
           [1m--refmap [22moption causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command-line arguments. See
           section on "Configured Remote-tracking Branches" for details.

       -t, --tags
           Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags [1mrefs/tags/* [22minto local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would
           otherwise be fetched. Using this option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if --prune is used (though tags may be pruned anyway
           if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see [1m--prune[22m).

       -j, --jobs=<n>
           Number of parallel children to be used for all forms of fetching.

           If the [1m--multiple [22moption was specified, the different remotes will be fetched in parallel. If multiple submodules are fetched, they will be
           fetched in parallel. To control them independently, use the config settings [1mfetch.parallel [22mand [1msubmodule.fetchJobs [22m(see [1mgit-config[22m(1)).

           Typically, parallel recursive and multi-remote fetches will be faster. By default fetches are performed sequentially, not in parallel.

       --set-upstream
           If the remote is fetched successfully, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less [1mgit-pull[22m(1) and other commands. For more
           information, see [1mbranch.<name>.merge [22mand [1mbranch.<name>.remote [22min [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       --upload-pack <upload-pack>
           When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by [4mgit[24m [4mfetch-pack[24m, [1m--exec=<upload-pack> [22mis passed to the command to specify
           non-default path for the command run on the other end.

       --progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag
           forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

       -o <option>, --server-option=<option>
           Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a NUL or LF
           character. The server’s handling of server options, including unknown ones, is server-specific. When multiple [1m--server-option=<option> [22mare
           given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line.

       --show-forced-updates
           By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. This can be disabled through fetch.showForcedUpdates, but the
           --show-forced-updates option guarantees this check occurs. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       --no-show-forced-updates
           By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. Pass --no-show-forced-updates or set fetch.showForcedUpdates to false to
           skip this check for performance reasons. If used during [4mgit-pull[24m the --ff-only option will still check for forced updates before attempting
           a fast-forward update. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       -4, --ipv4
           Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.

       -6, --ipv6
           Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.

       <repository>
           The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS
           below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).

       <refspec>
           Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. When no <refspec>s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read
           from [1mremote.<repository>.fetch [22mvariables instead (see the section "CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES" in [1mgit-fetch[22m(1)).

           The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus [1m+[22m, followed by the source <src>, followed by a colon [1m:[22m, followed by the destination
           ref <dst>. The colon can be omitted when <dst> is empty. <src> is typically a ref, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object name.

           A <refspec> may contain a [1m* [22min its <src> to indicate a simple pattern match. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref with
           the same prefix. A pattern <refspec> must have a [1m* [22min both the <src> and <dst>. It will map refs to the destination by replacing the [1m* [22mwith
           the contents matched from the source.

           If a refspec is prefixed by [1m^[22m, it will be interpreted as a negative refspec. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local refs
           to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude. A ref will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive
           refspec, and does not match any negative refspec. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it
           will not include specific refs. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs. However, they may only contain a <src> and do not
           specify a <dst>. Fully spelled out hex object names are also not supported.

           [1mtag <tag> [22mmeans the same as [1mrefs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>[22m; it requests fetching everything up to the given tag.

           The remote ref that matches <src> is fetched, and if <dst> is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local ref that matches
           it.

           Whether that update is allowed without [1m--force [22mdepends on the ref namespace it’s being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and
           whether the update is considered to be a fast-forward. Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the [1m<refspec>...[0m
           section of [1mgit-push[22m(1) for what those are. Exceptions to those rules particular to [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m are noted below.

           Until Git version 2.20, and unlike when pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), any updates to [1mrefs/tags/* [22mwould be accepted without [1m+ [22min the refspec (or
           [1m--force[22m). When fetching, we promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches. Since Git version 2.20, fetching
           to update [1mrefs/tags/* [22mworks the same way as when pushing. I.e. any updates will be rejected without [1m+ [22min the refspec (or [1m--force[22m).

           Unlike when pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), any updates outside of [1mrefs/{tags,heads}/* [22mwill be accepted without [1m+ [22min the refspec (or [1m--force[22m),
           whether that’s swapping e.g. a tree object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that doesn’t have the previous commit as an ancestor
           etc.

           Unlike when pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), there is no configuration which’ll amend these rules, and nothing like a [1mpre-fetch [22mhook analogous to
           the [1mpre-receive [22mhook.

           As with pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), all of the rules described above about what’s not allowed as an update can be overridden by adding an
           optional leading [1m+ [22mto a refspec (or using the [1m--force [22mcommand line option). The only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will
           make the [1mrefs/heads/* [22mnamespace accept a non-commit object.

               [1mNote[0m
               When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be a
               descendant of its previous tip (as stored in your remote-tracking branch the last time you fetched). You would want to use the [1m+ [22msign
               to indicate non-fast-forward updates will be needed for such branches. There is no way to determine or declare that a branch will be
               made available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.

               [1mNote[0m
               There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec> directly on [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m command line and having multiple
               [1mremote.<repository>.fetch [22mentries in your configuration for a <repository> and running a [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m command without any explicit
               <refspec> parameters. <refspec>s listed explicitly on the command line are always merged into the current branch after fetching. In
               other words, if you list more than one remote ref, [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m will create an Octopus merge. On the other hand, if you do not list any
               explicit <refspec> parameter on the command line, [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m will fetch all the <refspec>s it finds in the [1mremote.<repository>.fetch[0m
               configuration and merge only the first <refspec> found into the current branch. This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is
               rarely done, while keeping track of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more than one is often useful.

[1mGIT URLS[0m
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
       on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

       Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
       do not use them).

       The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

       The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       •   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       •   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       •   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       •   ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

       •   [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

       This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon. For
       example the local path [1mfoo:bar [22mcould be specified as an absolute path or [1m./foo:bar [22mto avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:

       •   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       •   git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       •   [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be used:

       •   /path/to/repo.git/

       •   file:///path/to/repo.git/

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the former implies --local option. See [1mgit-clone[22m(1) for details.

       [4mgit[24m [4mclone[24m, [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m, but not [4mgit[24m [4mpush[24m, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See [1mgit-bundle[22m(1).

       When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use the [4mremote-<transport>[24m remote helper, if one exists. To
       explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

       •   <transport>::<address>

       where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked. See
       [1mgitremote-helpers[22m(7) for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
       will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "<actual url base>"]
                           insteadOf = <other url base>

       For example, with this:

                   [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
                           insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                           insteadOf = work:

       a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
       "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "<actual url base>"]
                           pushInsteadOf = <other url base>

       For example, with this:

                   [url "ssh://example.org/"]
                           pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

       a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still use
       the original URL.

[1mREMOTES[0m
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as [1m<repository> [22margument:

       •   a remote in the Git configuration file: [1m$GIT_DIR/config[22m,

       •   a file in the [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes [22mdirectory, or

       •   a file in the [1m$GIT_DIR/branches [22mdirectory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

   [1mNamed remote in configuration file[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously configured using [1mgit-remote[22m(1), [1mgit-config[22m(1) or even by a manual edit
       to the [1m$GIT_DIR/config [22mfile. The URL of this remote will be used to access the repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by default
       when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. The entry in the config file would appear like this:

                   [remote "<name>"]
                           url = <URL>
                           pushurl = <pushurl>
                           push = <refspec>
                           fetch = <refspec>

       The [1m<pushurl> [22mis used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to [1m<URL>[22m. Pushing to a remote affects all defined pushurls or all defined
       urls if no pushurls are defined. Fetch, however, will only fetch from the first defined url if multiple urls are defined.

   [1mNamed file in $GIT_DIR/remotes[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes[22m. The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. The refspec in
       this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. This file should have the following format:

                   URL: one of the above URL formats
                   Push: <refspec>
                   Pull: <refspec>

       [1mPush: [22mlines are used by [4mgit[24m [4mpush[24m and [1mPull: [22mlines are used by [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m. Multiple [1mPush: [22mand [1mPull: [22mlines may be specified for
       additional branch mappings.

   [1mNamed file in $GIT_DIR/branches[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in [1m$GIT_DIR/branches[22m. The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. This file should
       have the following format:

                   <URL>#<head>

       [1m<URL> [22mis required; [1m#<head> [22mis optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs, if you don’t provide one on the command line. [1m<branch> [22mis the name of
       this file in [1m$GIT_DIR/branches [22mand [1m<head> [22mdefaults to [1mmaster[22m.

       git fetch uses:

                   refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>

       git push uses:

                   HEAD:refs/heads/<head>

[1mMERGE STRATEGIES[0m
       The merge mechanism ([1mgit merge [22mand [1mgit pull [22mcommands) allows the backend [4mmerge[24m [4mstrategies[24m to be chosen with [1m-s [22moption. Some strategies can also
       take their own options, which can be passed by giving [1m-X<option> [22marguments to [1mgit merge [22mand/or [1mgit pull[22m.

       ort
           This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch. This strategy can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
           algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors
           and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing
           mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this strategy can detect and
           handle merges involving renames. It does not make use of detected copies. The name for this algorithm is an acronym ("Ostensibly
           Recursive’s Twin") and came from the fact that it was written as a replacement for the previous default algorithm, [1mrecursive[22m.

           The [4mort[24m strategy can take the following options:

           ours
               This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by favoring [4mour[24m version. Changes from the other tree that do not
               conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result. For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.

               This should not be confused with the [4mours[24m merge strategy, which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards
               everything the other tree did, declaring [4mour[24m history contains all that happened in it.

           theirs
               This is the opposite of [4mours[24m; note that, unlike [4mours[24m, there is no [4mtheirs[24m merge strategy to confuse this merge option with.

           ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol, ignore-cr-at-eol
               Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with
               other changes to a line are not ignored. See also [1mgit-diff[22m(1) [1m-b[22m, [1m-w[22m, [1m--ignore-space-at-eol[22m, and [1m--ignore-cr-at-eol[22m.

               •   If [4mtheir[24m version only introduces whitespace changes to a line, [4mour[24m version is used;

               •   If [4mour[24m version introduces whitespace changes but [4mtheir[24m version includes a substantial change, [4mtheir[24m version is used;

               •   Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

           renormalize
               This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to be
               used when merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line normalization rules. See "Merging branches with differing
               checkin/checkout attributes" in [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

           no-renormalize
               Disables the [1mrenormalize [22moption. This overrides the [1mmerge.renormalize [22mconfiguration variable.

           find-renames[=<n>]
               Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold. This is the default. This overrides the [4mmerge.renames[0m
               configuration variable. See also [1mgit-diff[22m(1) [1m--find-renames[22m.

           rename-threshold=<n>
               Deprecated synonym for [1mfind-renames=<n>[22m.

           subtree[=<path>]
               This option is a more advanced form of [4msubtree[24m strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to match
               with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees
               to match.

       recursive
           This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3-way
           merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to
           result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development
           history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. It does not make use of detected copies. This was the default
           strategy for resolving two heads from Git v0.99.9k until v2.33.0.

           The [4mrecursive[24m strategy takes the same options as [4mort[24m. However, there are three additional options that [4mort[24m ignores (not documented above)
           that are potentially useful with the [4mrecursive[24m strategy:

           patience
               Deprecated synonym for [1mdiff-algorithm=patience[22m.

           diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]
               Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines (such as
               braces from distinct functions). See also [1mgit-diff[22m(1) [1m--diff-algorithm[22m. Note that [1mort [22mspecifically uses [1mdiff-algorithm=histogram[22m, while
               [1mrecursive [22mdefaults to the [1mdiff.algorithm [22mconfig setting.

           no-renames
               Turn off rename detection. This overrides the [1mmerge.renames [22mconfiguration variable. See also [1mgit-diff[22m(1) [1m--no-renames[22m.

       resolve
           This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
           carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities. It does not handle renames.

       octopus
           This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be
           used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.

       ours
           This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all
           changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches. Note that this is different
           from the -Xours option to the [4mrecursive[24m merge strategy.

       subtree
           This is a modified [1mort [22mstrategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree
           structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.

       With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, [4mort[24m), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
       branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and the
       merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as
       no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.

[1mDEFAULT BEHAVIOUR[0m
       Often people use [1mgit pull [22mwithout giving any parameter. Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying [1mgit pull origin[22m. However, when
       configuration [1mbranch.<name>.remote [22mis present while on branch [1m<name>[22m, that value is used instead of [1morigin[22m.

       In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value of the configuration [1mremote.<origin>.url [22mis consulted and if there is not any
       such variable, the value on the [1mURL: [22mline in [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin> [22mis used.

       In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and optionally store in the remote-tracking branches) when the command is run without any
       refspec parameters on the command line, values of the configuration variable [1mremote.<origin>.fetch [22mare consulted, and if there aren’t any,
       [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin> [22mis consulted and its [1mPull: [22mlines are used. In addition to the refspec formats described in the OPTIONS section, you
       can have a globbing refspec that looks like this:

       A globbing refspec must have a non-empty RHS (i.e. must store what were fetched in remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS must end with
       [1m/*[22m. The above specifies that all remote branches are tracked using remote-tracking branches in [1mrefs/remotes/origin/ [22mhierarchy under the same
       name.

       The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after fetching is a bit involved, in order not to break backward compatibility.

       If explicit refspecs were given on the command line of [1mgit pull[22m, they are all merged.

       When no refspec was given on the command line, then [1mgit pull [22muses the refspec from the configuration or [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>[22m. In such
       cases, the following rules apply:

        1. If [1mbranch.<name>.merge [22mconfiguration for the current branch [1m<name> [22mexists, that is the name of the branch at the remote site that is
           merged.

        2. If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is merged.

        3. Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is merged.

       •   Update the remote-tracking branches for the repository you cloned from, then merge one of them into your current branch:

               $ git pull
               $ git pull origin

           Normally the branch merged in is the HEAD of the remote repository, but the choice is determined by the branch.<name>.remote and
           branch.<name>.merge options; see [1mgit-config[22m(1) for details.

       •   Merge into the current branch the remote branch [1mnext[22m:

               $ git pull origin next

           This leaves a copy of [1mnext [22mtemporarily in FETCH_HEAD, and updates the remote-tracking branch [1morigin/next[22m. The same can be done by invoking
           fetch and merge:

               $ git fetch origin
               $ git merge origin/next

       If you tried a pull which resulted in complex conflicts and would want to start over, you can recover with [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m.

       The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
       shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This
       applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant
       read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository.

       The known attack vectors are as follows:

        1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to
           optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to
           send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X
           back to the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the
           namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a
           public branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)

        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker
           falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the
           attacker.

       Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already checked out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in
       the just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule itself cannot be fetched, making it impossible to check out that submodule later
       without having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git version.
